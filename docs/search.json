I also support ocean advocacy through digital work with the Ocean Decade Heritage Network.\nThis blog is a place for me to think out loud. Expect posts research communication, digital tools, maybe some code, and probably a few ocean-related tangents too.\nAll views here are my own.\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts."
